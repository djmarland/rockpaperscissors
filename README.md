# Rock Paper Scissors

This game is visible at https://rland.me.uk/rockpaperscissors

It has been written purposely without any frameworks.
No extra dependencies beyond the original set have been added.

It would be tidier for HTML templates if it instead used React or Mustache.

The game model is tested, but I did not have time to complete tests
for the whole application.

Improvements to be made:
* Use/build an event delegator so individual handlers don't need to be used
* Generate buttons dynamically so the moves aren't hardcoded
* Use a template structure, rather than showing/hiding elements
